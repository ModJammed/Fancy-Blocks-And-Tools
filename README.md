ModJam-Fancyblocks
==================

Fancyblocks mod was created by Justin Johnson (darkflame380/darksidea380) for ModJam 2013
Mod will be kept updated and new features will eventually be added

This mod has 32 new blocks including fancybricks as well as stained glass and a new set of tools.
the new tool mine slightly faster than iron but have a 1000 uses.


As of now my block id's are not configurable but will add that in ASAP. with that being said my block id range is
1000-1035

and my item id range is
5500-5506

My next step will be to add metadata(so i dont have so many block id's) and use the oredictionary so if anyone wants to
use my ores in a mod or somthing
